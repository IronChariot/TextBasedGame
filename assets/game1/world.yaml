          backstory: |
            Mrs. Emily Thompson had been stealing money from her husband to fund her gambling habit and was afraid of being caught.
            When Mr. Thompson discovered her crime, she killed him with the letter opener during a confrontation in the study, when he threatened to divorce her and have her arrested. 
            Mrs. Thompson decided to frame the maid, Ms. Sarah Baker, for the murder, by secretly placing an empty envelope labelled 'book advance payment' in Ms. Baker's purse.
            After the police cleared away the body, they invited Sherlock Holmes to come and question everyone who had been around on the day of the murder.
          current_context: |
            Ms. Sarah Baker and Mr. James Wilson arrived at the house at 8 o'clock in the morning, as instructed by the police. No-one has spoken much today.
            Mrs. Emily Thompson made some tea and served it in the living room for Mr. Wilson and herself while they wait, sitting on the sofa.
            It is the 12th of May. Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson arrived at the house at around 9 o'clock in the morning. 
            Sherlock Holmes has gone west to the study, and Dr. Watson has gone south to the kitchen in order to talk to the maid.

          backstory: |
            Mr. James Wilson was the editor working with Mr. Robert Thompson.
            He has a very bad reputation when it comes to how he treats women, which is mostly well earned.
            He has a bad temper and can be impatient with his clients.
            Mr. Wilson had a big argument with Mr. Thompson earlier on the day before the crime was committed. He is nervous that this will make people suspect him.
          current_context: |
            James Wilson arrived at the Thompson residence today, the 12th of May, 3 days after the murder, at 8 o'clock in the morning, as requested by the police.
            Ms. Sarah Baker arrived at around this time as well, and while he attempted to flirt with her, she made an excuse and moved away to the kitchen.
            Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson arrived at around 9 o'clock, whereupon Holmes went to investigate the study and Watson went to the kitchen.
            Though not much conversation has happened, Mrs. Thompson has offered James some tea, and they now sit in the living room, waiting for Sherlock Holmes to conduct the investigation.

            Sarah excused herself to the kitchen, saying that she should tidy up there.
            Mrs. Emily Thompson later came to the kitchen to make some tea for herself and Mr. Wilson. Emily complimented Sarah on her nice handbag that she had put down, examining it briefly.
